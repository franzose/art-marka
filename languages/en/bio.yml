    <p>Being occupied by making photos, you see the world from a&nbsp;different angle.</p>
    <p>One could compare it to the fact that one person sees a puddle just as dirt and another discovers a Space in it.
    I have a will to show that Space to others. Photo&nbsp;helps to notice interesting details and nuances,
    that many people leave behind… And sometimes stocks and stones acquire a soul…</p>
    <p>To descry beauty in everything that surrounds you, to give it to others and&nbsp;to enjoy the moment!</p>
